    <h3>The Things I Know That I Love</h3>
    <p><em>By Olivia</em></p>

    <p>I know that I love the sky, I look up at it with awe.<br>
    I know I love the clouds with their intriguing designs.<br>
    I love my friends and I love my family.<br>
    I love stories of things that could never exist.<br>
    I like the way things make me feel, even anger and pain.<br>
    Then those millions of times when they don't have a name.</p>

    <p>I love the smell of the outside air every time I open the window.<br>
    I long to lie on the ground and stare up at the sky of brave blue.<br>
    I love the feel of the world beneath me, surrounding me, renewing me.</p>

    <p>The clouds in the sky are like fictional dragons, horses, and whales with wings.<br>
    They migrate across the ocean above me to somewhere I won't ever see.</p>

    <p>The sunlight reaching through the leaves is a wonderful thing indeed.<br>
    It struggles peacefully through the green and shines on through the leaves.</p>

    <p>I love to read others' writing and wander around lost in their art.<br>
    I wish I could go back and meet them to ask them how they think.</p>

    <p>I love the thought of time, the immortal queen of the universe.<br>
    I love my friends and would never leave them even if they are endlessly annoying.</p>

    <p>I love the ones I know I'll lose, and I love the things I won't.<br>
    The chirping of the birds, ringing on all day.<br>
    As the crickets take over for the change of night to day.</p>

    <p>I love the world. I love the life, I love the time we have.<br>
    I don't know if there's something I don't love because I love a lot.</p>

    <p>I never am sure if love is the right word, maybe it's awe, maybe it's amazement, maybe it's my envy of the birds.<br>
    I think I happen to be a wolf, loyal to her pack.<br>
    Though I am a wolf, I am a wolfâ€”a wolf who longs to fly.<br>
    I want to feel the wind under my wings and feel the brave blue of the sky.<br>
    I want to look down at the earth from somewhere up high.</p>

    <p>I love the things I have and the things I don't.<br>
    I love the things that could be and the questions of the world.<br>
    I love the number 7, and the number 5, and perhaps all of them from 1 to 9.</p>

    <p>I love the way eyes look when they're caught within the sun.<br>
    The transparent color that presents all others.</p>

    <p>I love the darkness of my room.<br>
    The glowing blue-black from the bank.</p>

    <p>I love the way my life is and the way it isn't.<br>
    I also always fall for the smell of an old book, that will tell a story other than mine.<br>
    Open up the pages of golden dirty brown, put the thoughts in your head of the story you've found.</p>
